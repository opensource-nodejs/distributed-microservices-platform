## Explanation of Each Component

### Root Files
1. **`.env`**
   - **Purpose:**  
     Contains environment variables for configuring the service.
   - **Example Variables:**  
     - `PORT`: The port on which the service will run (default: 5003).  
     - `SERVICE_NAME`: The name of the service.  
     - `MESSAGE_BROKER_URL`: URL for the message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ).  
   - **Why it's Needed:**  
     Allows you to manage configuration values outside of the codebase, making the service easier to deploy and manage across environments.

2. **`package.json`**
   - **Purpose:**  
     Manages dependencies, scripts, and metadata for the `notification-service`.
   - **Key Fields:**  
     - `dependencies`: Lists required Node.js libraries like `express`, `dotenv`, and `body-parser`.  
     - `scripts`: Defines commands like `npm start` to run the application.
   - **Why it's Needed:**  
     Facilitates dependency management and quick service setup.

### `src/` Directory
Contains all the code for the service. It's divided into modules for separation of concerns.

#### 1. **`src/app.js`**
   - **Purpose:**  
     The main entry point of the service.
   - **Key Responsibilities:**  
     - Sets up the Express server.  
     - Configures middleware (e.g., `body-parser` for JSON parsing).  
     - Mounts routes from the `notificationRoutes.js` file.  
     - Starts the server on the configured port.
   - **Why it's Needed:**  
     Orchestrates the entire service and binds all components together.

---

#### 2. **`src/controllers/notificationController.js`**
   - **Purpose:**  
     Handles incoming requests and orchestrates the appropriate business logic from the service layer.
   - **Key Responsibilities:**  
     - Validates request payloads.  
     - Calls the `notificationService` to perform business logic.  
     - Returns responses to the client.
   - **Why it's Needed:**  
     Decouples HTTP request/response handling from business logic.

---

#### 3. **`src/routes/notificationRoutes.js`**
   - **Purpose:**  
     Defines the HTTP endpoints for the service.
   - **Key Responsibilities:**  
     - Maps HTTP routes (e.g., `/send`) to corresponding controller methods.  
     - Ensures routes are modular and reusable.
   - **Why it's Needed:**  
     Keeps route definitions organized and separate from business logic.

---

#### 4. **`src/services/notificationService.js`**
   - **Purpose:**  
     Implements the core business logic of the service.
   - **Key Responsibilities:**  
     - Validates the type of notification (e.g., email, SMS, push).  
     - Simulates sending a notification by logging the details.  
     - Returns the status of the operation.
   - **Why it's Needed:**  
     Centralizes business logic, making it easier to test and maintain.

---

## Example Workflow
When a client sends a request to send a notification, the following sequence occurs:
1. **Route Handling:**  
   - The request hits the `/api/notifications/send` endpoint, defined in `notificationRoutes.js`.

2. **Controller Logic:**  
   - The `notificationController` validates the payload and delegates the operation to the `notificationService`.

3. **Business Logic Execution:**  
   - The `notificationService` processes the notification and simulates sending it (e.g., logs the action).

4. **Response to Client:**  
   - The `notificationController` returns a success response to the client with details of the notification sent.

---

## How to Extend
1. **Add New Notification Types:**  
   - Update `notificationService.js` to support additional types like WhatsApp or in-app notifications.

2. **Connect to a Real Notification Provider:**  
   - Replace the simulated logic in `notificationService.js` with actual APIs for email (e.g., SendGrid), SMS (e.g., Twilio), or push notifications (e.g., Firebase).

3. **Add Tests:**  
   - Create unit tests for controllers and services to ensure reliability.

4. **Integrate Message Broker:**  
   - Extend the service to consume notification tasks from a queue (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka).
