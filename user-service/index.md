### **1. `src/app.js`**
**Purpose:**
- This is the **entry point** of the service.
- It sets up the Express server, middleware, routes, and health checks.

**What it does:**
- Configures the server to listen for incoming HTTP requests.
- Registers the user routes (`/api/users`).
- Includes a health-check endpoint (`GET /health`) for monitoring the service's status.
- Starts the service on the specified port.

---

### **2. `src/controllers/userController.js`**
**Purpose:**
- This file contains the **controller functions** that handle incoming requests.
- It acts as the middle layer between the routes and the service layer.

**What it does:**
- Processes HTTP requests (e.g., GET or POST).
- Calls the appropriate service function to perform the requested operation.
- Returns the response to the client (e.g., JSON data or error messages).

**Example:**  
When a user sends a `POST` request to create a new user, the controller will:
- Extract the request data.
- Pass it to the `userService.createUser()` function.
- Return the result (or an error) as an HTTP response.

---

### **3. `src/routes/userRoutes.js`**
**Purpose:**
- Defines the **API endpoints** for the service.
- Maps HTTP methods (e.g., `GET`, `POST`) and routes (e.g., `/api/users`) to the corresponding controller functions.

**What it does:**
- Maps a `GET` request at `/api/users` to `userController.getAllUsers()`.
- Maps a `POST` request at `/api/users` to `userController.createUser()`.

**Example:**  
When a user accesses `http://localhost:5000/api/users`, this file ensures the `getAllUsers` function is called.

---

### **4. `src/models/userModel.js`**
**Purpose:**
- Defines the **database schema** and model for user data.
- Maps the user-related data to a MongoDB collection using Mongoose.

**What it does:**
- Specifies the structure of user documents in MongoDB (e.g., name, email, password).
- Enforces data validation (e.g., email must be unique).
- Enables interaction with MongoDB using Mongoose methods (`find()`, `save()`, etc.).

**Example:**  
If a new user is created, this file ensures the `name`, `email`, and `password` fields are stored in the correct format.

---

### **5. `src/services/userService.js`**
**Purpose:**
- Contains the **business logic** of the service.
- Acts as the intermediary between the controller and the database model.

**What it does:**
- Implements functions to perform operations like retrieving all users or creating a new user.
- Interacts with the database model (`userModel`) to execute the operations.

**Example:**  
The `createUser()` function in this file:
- Accepts user data.
- Creates a new user document using the Mongoose model (`User`).
- Saves it to the database.

---

### **6. `package.json`**
**Purpose:**
- Defines the **dependencies**, scripts, and metadata of the service.

**What it does:**
- Lists the required Node.js modules (`express`, `mongoose`, `body-parser`, etc.).
- Specifies scripts like `npm start` for starting the service.
- Helps with dependency installation (`npm install`).

---

### **7. `.env`**
**Purpose:**
- Stores **environment-specific configuration** values.

**What it does:**
- Contains sensitive or configurable values like:
  - The service's port number (`PORT`).
  - The MongoDB connection string (`MONGO_URI`).

**Example:**  
You can switch between development and production databases by changing the `MONGO_URI` in this file.

---

### **8. `README.md`**
**Purpose:**
- Provides **documentation** for the service.

**What it does:**
- Describes what the service does and how to set it up.
- Lists prerequisites, setup instructions, API endpoints, and contribution guidelines.
- Serves as a reference for developers working on the service.

### How the Files Work Together

1. **Client Request:**  
   A client sends a request (e.g., `POST /api/users`).

2. **Routes (`userRoutes.js`):**  
   The route maps this request to the `createUser` controller function.

3. **Controller (`userController.js`):**  
   The controller extracts the data from the request and calls the `createUser` function in the service layer.

4. **Service (`userService.js`):**  
   The service creates a new user document using the Mongoose model and saves it to the database.

5. **Model (`userModel.js`):**  
   The Mongoose model ensures the user data is stored correctly in MongoDB.

6. **Response:**  
   The service returns the result to the controller, which sends it as a response to the client.

This modular architecture ensures separation of concerns, making the service easier to maintain, test, and extend. Let me know if you need further clarification!
